1. What is the purpose of the NVIC peripheral?

The NVIC controls coordinates the handling of interrupts throughout the system.

2. What is the difference between interrupt tail-chaining and nesting?

Tail-chaining occurs when interrupt handlers execute in succession according to
their hardware priority. Nesting allows more important handlers to interrupt
lower priority handlers.

3. In what file are the CMSIS libraries that control the NVIC?

The core_cm0.h file.

4. What is the purpose of the EXTI peripheral?

It allows non-peripheral sources to trigger interrupts.

5. What is the purpose of the SYSCFG pin multiplexers?

Select which pins to connect to the limited EXTI inputs.

6. What file has the defined names for interrupt numbers?

The stm32f0xb.h file.

7. What file has the Vector table implementation?

The startup_stm32f072xb.s file.
