1. The lab describes the following registers

- MODER: controls input/output mode
- OTYPER: controls output type (push-pull or open drain)
- OSPEEDR: controls output speed (low, medium, high)
- PUPDRR: IO pull-up or pull-down

2. Bits 0b11 set the mode to analog mode for that pin.

3. The fourth bit of the upper half of the bit set / reset register (BSRR)

4. We have

0xAD | 0xC7 = 0xEF
0xAD & 0xC7 = 0x85
0xAD & ~(0xC7) = 0x28
0xAD ^ 0xC7 = 0x6A

5. Invert a bitmask with the only the 5th and 6th bits set, then bitwise and the register with the resulting value.

6. According to the I/O AC characteristics table, there is a 2 MHz maximum
frequency at the lowest OSPEEDR configuration value.

7.

- TIM1: the AHBENR register
- DMA1: the DIER register
- IC21: the I2C1EN register
